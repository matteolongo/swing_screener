# Swing Screener — Operational Guide (Day‑to‑Day Use)

This document explains **how to actually use Swing Screener in practice**, day after day,
with minimal manual work and zero improvisation.

This is **not** a beginner explanation of trading concepts
and **not** a technical developer README.

Think of this as:
> *“What do I do every day, in which order, and why.”*

## What this README is (and is not)

### This file IS:
- a practical operating manual
- focused on real execution (Degiro-friendly)
- aligned with the CLI and notebooks you built
- meant to be followed mechanically

### This file is NOT:
- a replacement for `README.md`
- a replacement for `README_BEGINNER.md`
- a replacement for `README_technical.md`

👉 **This is a new document. Do NOT replace existing READMEs.**

Recommended location:
```
docs/OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md
```

## Mental model (important)

Swing Screener is split into **three responsibilities**:

1. **Screening** → find new trade candidates
2. **Execution** → place orders manually (Degiro)
3. **Management** → update stops / exits on open positions

The software handles **(1) and (3)**.  
You handle **(2)**.

---

## Files you should care about

### 1) `positions.json`
Your **single source of truth** for open trades.

Contains:
- entry price
- stop loss
- shares
- trade state

You update this file **only when you open or close trades**.

---

### 2) `out/report.csv`
Daily **new trade candidates**.

Generated by:
```bash
swing-screener run ...
```

---

### 3) `out/degiro_actions.md`
Daily **checklist for Degiro** (manage existing positions).

Generated by:
```bash
swing-screener manage ...
```

This is the most important operational output.

---

## Daily routine (Barcelona / CET)

### ⏰ When
**Every trading day after US market close**:

- Barcelona winter: ~22:15
- Barcelona summer: ~22:30

Never run during market hours.

---

## Step 1 — Find new trade candidates

Run the screener:

```bash
swing-screener run --universe mega --csv out/report.csv
```

This does:
- loads tickers automatically
- computes trend, momentum, volatility
- ranks candidates
- computes entry / stop / shares

### What you do next
- Open `out/report.csv`
- Look ONLY at rows with a valid `signal`
- Decide whether to take the trade

No signal → no trade.

---

## Step 2 — Place orders in Degiro

For each trade you accept:

1. Place a **BUY order** (limit or market)
2. Place a **STOP LOSS order**
3. Confirm position size matches `shares`

⚠️ Do not:
- adjust position size emotionally
- widen the stop
- enter without a stop

---

## Step 3 — Register the trade

Immediately update `positions.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "ticker": "INTC",
  "status": "open",
  "entry_date": "2026-01-13",
  "entry_price": 47.29,
  "stop_price": 42.88,
  "shares": 1,
  "notes": "breakout"
}
```

If it’s not in `positions.json`, it does not exist.

---

## Step 4 — Manage existing positions (every day)

Run:

```bash
swing-screener manage --positions positions.json --md out/degiro_actions.md
```

This:
- reloads open positions
- recalculates R-multiples
- suggests stop updates or exits
- produces a **Degiro-ready checklist**

Open:
```
out/degiro_actions.md
```

Follow it line by line.

---

## Step 5 — Apply stop updates (optional but recommended)

If you want the software to keep your local state in sync:

```bash
swing-screener manage --positions positions.json --apply --md out/degiro_actions.md
```

This:
- updates stop prices in `positions.json`
- NEVER lowers a stop
- only applies `MOVE_STOP_UP` actions

Degiro execution remains manual.

---

## How exits work (very important)

A position can be closed because:

1. **Stop loss hit**
2. **Time exit**
3. **Trend breakdown (via trailing stop)**

The system will tell you:
```
CLOSE_STOP_HIT
CLOSE_TIME_EXIT
```

When you close a trade in Degiro:
- mark it as `status: closed` in `positions.json`
- or remove it entirely

---

## What NOT to do

- Do NOT run intraday
- Do NOT move stops down
- Do NOT override signals emotionally
- Do NOT change rules mid-trade

This system works because it is boring.

---

## Weekly routine (10 minutes)

Once per week:
- review closed trades
- check if rules were followed
- do NOT tweak parameters

---

## Monthly routine (optional)

- review performance metrics
- adjust parameters **only if necessary**
- document changes

---

## Final note

If you follow this guide:
- decisions are consistent
- workload is minimal
- emotions are reduced

Swing Screener is not about being right.
It is about being **systematic**.
