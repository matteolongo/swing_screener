# Swing Screener — Operational Guide (Day‑to‑Day Use)

This document explains **how to actually use Swing Screener in practice**, day after day,
with minimal manual work and zero improvisation.

This is **not** a beginner explanation of trading concepts
and **not** a technical developer README.

Think of this as:
> *“What do I do every day, in which order, and why.”*

---

## What this README is (and is not)

### This file IS:
- a practical operating manual
- focused on real execution (Degiro-friendly)
- aligned with the CLI and notebooks you built
- meant to be followed mechanically

### This file is NOT:
- a replacement for `README.md`
- a replacement for `README_BEGINNER.md`
- a replacement for `README_technical.md`

👉 **This is a new document. Do NOT replace existing READMEs.**

Recommended location:
```
docs/OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md
```

---

## Mental model (important)

Swing Screener is split into **three responsibilities**:

1. **Screening** → find new trade candidates
2. **Execution** → place orders manually (Degiro)
3. **Management** → update stops / exits on open positions

The software handles **(1) and (3)**.  
You handle **(2)**.

---

## Files you should care about

### 1) `positions.json`
Your **single source of truth** for open trades.

Contains:
- entry price
- stop loss
- shares
- trade state
Optional linkage fields:
- `position_id`
- `source_order_id`
- `exit_order_ids` (stop/TP orders)

You update this file **only when you open or close trades**.

---

### 2) `orders.json`
Tracks **orders** (entry/stop/TP) and their status.

You update this file when you **place, cancel, or fill orders**.

Optional CLI helper (entry fill):

```bash
swing-screener orders fill --orders orders.json --positions positions.json \
  --order-id ORD-XYZ --fill-price 12.34 --fill-date 2026-02-02 \
  --quantity 5 --stop-price 11.80
```

---

### 3) `out/report.csv`
Daily **new trade candidates**.

Generated by:
```bash
swing-screener run ...
```

---

### 4) `out/degiro_actions.md`
Daily **checklist for Degiro** (manage existing positions).

Generated by:
```bash
swing-screener manage ...
```

This is the most important operational output.

---

## Orders vs positions (important)

- `orders.json` tracks **entry/stop/TP orders** (status: pending/filled/cancelled).
- `positions.json` tracks **open positions** you currently hold.
- When an entry order is **filled**, it should create a position and link to it.
- Stop-loss and take-profit are separate **exit orders** linked to that position.

To backfill links (and optionally create missing stop orders):

```bash
swing-screener migrate --orders orders.json --positions positions.json --create-stop-orders
```

---

## Daily routine (Barcelona / CET)

### ⏰ When
**Every trading day after US market close**:

- Barcelona winter: ~22:15
- Barcelona summer: ~22:30

Never run during market hours.

---

## Step 1 — Find new trade candidates

Run the screener:

```bash
swing-screener run --universe mega --positions positions.json --csv out/report.csv
```

This does:
- loads tickers automatically
- computes trend, momentum, volatility
- ranks candidates
- computes entry / stop / shares
- excludes open positions from new candidates

### What you do next
- Open `out/report.csv`
- Look ONLY at rows with a valid `signal`
- Decide whether to take the trade

No signal → no trade.

### Execution Guidance Fields
The report now includes explicit execution hints for next-day orders:
- `entry` is NOT an order price; it is used for sizing and risk math only.
- Use `suggested_order_type`, `suggested_order_price`, and `execution_note` as the only execution guidance.
- `suggested_validity` is always `DAY`.
- If present, `order_price_band_low` / `order_price_band_high` show a limit-entry range.

---

## Step 2 — Place orders in Degiro

For each trade you accept:

1. Place a **BUY order** (limit or market)
2. Place a **STOP LOSS order**
3. Confirm position size matches `shares`

⚠️ Do not:
- adjust position size emotionally
- widen the stop
- enter without a stop

### Scale-in (add to a winner)

If you add to an existing open position:
- Record the new entry as a pending order in `orders.json`.
- When it fills, choose **Scale-in** in the UI Orders tab.
- The system blends the entry price and shares, keeps the existing stop, and recomputes `initial_risk`.
- Scale-in logic is shared across UI and CLI utilities for consistent results.

CLI alternative:

```bash
swing-screener orders scale-in --orders orders.json --positions positions.json \
  --order-id ORD-XYZ --fill-price 12.34 --fill-date 2026-02-02 --quantity 5
```

---

## Step 3 — Register the trade

Immediately update `positions.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "ticker": "INTC",
  "status": "open",
  "entry_date": "2026-01-13",
  "entry_price": 47.29,
  "stop_price": 42.88,
  "shares": 1,
  "notes": "breakout"
}
```

If it’s not in `positions.json`, it does not exist.

---

## Step 4 — Manage existing positions (every day)

Run:

```bash
swing-screener manage --positions positions.json --md out/degiro_actions.md
```

This:
- reloads open positions
- recalculates R-multiples
- suggests stop updates or exits
- produces a **Degiro-ready checklist**

Open:
```
out/degiro_actions.md
```

Follow it line by line.

---

## Step 5 — Apply stop updates (optional but recommended)

If you want the software to keep your local state in sync:

```bash
swing-screener manage --positions positions.json --apply --md out/degiro_actions.md
```

This:
- updates stop prices in `positions.json`
- NEVER lowers a stop
- only applies `MOVE_STOP_UP` actions

Degiro execution remains manual.

---

## Building and curating universes (new)

You can now inspect, filter, and save universes via CLI:

- **List packaged universes**
  ```bash
  swing-screener universes list
  ```
- **Preview with filters (include/exclude/grep)**
  ```bash
  swing-screener universes show --name mega --top 20 --grep A --exclude AAPL
  ```
- **Filter and save to a CSV** (reusable with `--universe-file`)
  ```bash
  swing-screener universes filter --name mega --grep X --out data/universes/custom_x.csv
  ```
  Options:
  - `--include / --exclude` literal tickers
  - `--grep` substring match (case-insensitive)
  - `--benchmark`/`--no-benchmark` to keep or drop the benchmark
  - `--max` to cap length after filtering

Saved CSVs are plain newline-separated tickers and can be referenced with:
```bash
swing-screener run --universe-file data/universes/custom_x.csv --positions positions.json
```

---

## How exits work (very important)

A position can be closed because:

1. **Stop loss hit**
2. **Time exit**
3. **Trend breakdown (via trailing stop)**

The system will tell you:
```
CLOSE_STOP_HIT
CLOSE_TIME_EXIT
```

When you close a trade in Degiro:
- mark it as `status: closed` in `positions.json`
- or remove it entirely

---

## What NOT to do

- Do NOT run intraday
- Do NOT move stops down
- Do NOT override signals emotionally
- Do NOT change rules mid-trade

This system works because it is boring.

---

## Weekly routine (10 minutes)

Once per week:
- review closed trades
- check if rules were followed
- do NOT tweak parameters

---

## Monthly routine (optional)

- review performance metrics
- adjust parameters **only if necessary**
- document changes

---

## Final note

If you follow this guide:
- decisions are consistent
- workload is minimal
- emotions are reduced

Swing Screener is not about being right.
It is about being **systematic**.
